# About This Blog

### Reasons for writing this blog

I've always known the importance of taking notes, and indeed, I take a lot of notes whenever I learn something new. However, I gradually realized that the way I'm taking notes is too casual. Oftentimes, I just wrote down what I've learned word by word without thinking hard about the subject. And after I took those notes, I rarely refer back to them since they are hardly well-organized and less enjoyable to read. **Simply put, `ctrl + c & ctrl + v != learning`!**

As a result, taking notes did not benefit me much since two important steps are missing here:

1. summarizing what I've learned into a well-organized easy-to-read format
2. frequent reviewing to reinforce them in my brains (since memory is repetition and reinforcement)

Writing blogs would be a perfect way of ensuring that I never skip these two steps.

### What this blog is about

In this blog, I'll be writing everything I learned, mostly about backend development, since that's where my interest lies.

I'll also try to document some of my thoughts on life or books since **we think while we write**.
